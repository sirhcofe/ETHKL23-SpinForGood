## Features

Our Web3 Gamified Donation Platform offers several unique features:

1. Roulette Twist: When a donation is made, 25% of the contribution goes into a prize pool. The lucky donor who gets chosen by the roulette will win the prize, making giving more exciting.

2. Support for NPOs: The remaining 75% of the donation goes into the donation pool. Within this pool, 50% is evenly distributed among all registered NPOs to support their causes. The other 50% goes into a separate roulette for NPOs, where one lucky NPO will receive extra funds.

3. Smart Contract Powered: All fund management and the random selection of lucky winners are handled by a secure and transparent smart contract, ensuring fair and unbiased outcomes.

<br/>

## Technology Stack

1. Ethereum: The core of our platform relies on Ethereum smart contracts to manage donations, prizes, and roulette selections.

2. Scaffold-eth: The scaffold-eth framework provides the foundation for our project, including contract functions, and more. We've extended and customized the platform to incorporate the gamified donation features.

3. Next.js: The frontend of the platform is built using React, offering a responsive and intuitive user interface.

4. Solidity: The smart contracts are written in Solidity to ensure security and transparency.
